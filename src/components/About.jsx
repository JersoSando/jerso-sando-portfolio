        <p>Before becoming a web developer, I graduated with my Bachelors in Biology at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. After graduating
                I worked as a behavioral therapist with young kids. After a while, I wanted something more challenging and got into coding.
                I fell in love with problem solving and building websites from the ground up. 
    
                When I'm not coding, I love reading, running, and hanging out with my friends and family. 
                I love to travel and will always search out the best coffee and bookstores wherever I go.</p>
